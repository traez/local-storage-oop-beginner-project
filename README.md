## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

1) Nothing special here really. Just a Local Storage OOP Beginner project to get familiar with the matter 

### Continued development

With this small win, I have the confidence to tackle the following Object-Oriented Programming projects subsequently:  
1) Flashcard Intermediate/OOP Project from jsbeginners.com  
2) Crowdfunding product page coding challenge from Frontend Mentor  
3) Interactive comments section coding challenge from Frontend Mentor  

### Useful resources

Stackoverflow, MDN Web Docs, w3schools, YouTube, Google
